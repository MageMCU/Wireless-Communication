# Wireless-Communication
- After six months of review, I have decided to start with these devices. It is my hope to complete this project by the end of 2024. The devices listed with be used with Arduino and Raspberry Pi while maintaining at a low cost.
- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi 5 8GB using the Raspberry Pi OS (for VS Code).
  - Setup ...

## Nordic nRF24L01
- Nordic Semiconductor designs and produces SoC, SiP, and connectivity solutions for the ISM bands at 5 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 868/915 MHz bands. The ISM radio bands are portions of the radio spectrum reserved internationally for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) purposes, excluding applications in telecommunications. The products operate on low power, enabling wireless and IoT applications to use little battery and run on harvested energy. Popular Nordic Semiconductor products include the nRF24L01+ and the nRF24LE1, both using the lightweight and proprietary "Enhanced ShockBurst" protocol stack in 2.4 GHz ISM band. The nRF24L01+ is a simple transceiver with some logic to implement the protocol stack and is connected to a microcontroller via an SPI bus, while the nRF24LE1 can be seen as an nRF24L01 and a microcontroller in the same chip.
